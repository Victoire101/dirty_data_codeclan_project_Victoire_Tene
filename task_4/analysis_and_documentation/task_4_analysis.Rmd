Q1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

```{r}
 
  
candies_only <- select(full_candy, - timestamp, -age, -going_out, -year,
                       -hugs_actual_physical_hugs, -state_province_county_etc, -country, -gender)
names <- names(candies_only)

 total <-sum(!is.na(candies_only))

total_number_of_candy_rating <-  paste('the total number of candy rating is : ',  total , sep = '')
                                        
total_number_of_candy_rating
```

Q2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?

```{r}

going_out <- subset(full_candy, going_out == "Yes" & age >= 1 & age <= 100)

 mean_age <- mean(going_out$age, na.rm = TRUE)

avg_age_of_people_going_out <- paste('the average of people going out trick or treating is ', 
                               mean_age, sep = '' )

avg_age_of_people_going_out
```

Q3. What was the average age of people who are not going trick or treating?
```{r}
going_out_no <- subset(full_candy, going_out == "No" & age >= 1 & age <= 100)

mean_age_1 <- mean(going_out_no$age, na.rm = TRUE)

avg_age_of_people_not_going_out <- paste('the average of people not going out trick or treating is ', 
                               mean_age_1, sep = '' )

avg_age_of_people_not_going_out
```
Q4. For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar received the most of these ratings?

```{r}
candies_only

# pivot longer on the candies columns

candies_only_long  <- pivot_longer(candies_only,
                                   cols = c(1:98),
                                   names_to = "candies",
                                   values_to = "rating")

# counting number of rating per candy
 
rating_count <- candies_only_long %>% 
  count(candies, rating)  


joy <- rating_count %>% 
  slice_max(rating == "JOY") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

meh <- rating_count %>% 
  slice_max(rating == "MEH") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

despair <- rating_count %>% 
  slice_max(rating == "DESPAIR") %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

joy
meh
despair

answer <- paste( 'Joy: any_full_sized_candy_bar, Meh: lollipops, Despair: broken_glow_stick ')
                   
                   
answer
 
```


Q5.How many people rated Starburst as despair?

```{r}
rating_count %>% 
  filter(candies == "starburst",rating == "DESPAIR") 

 
```

 For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1, and meh as 0.

Q6. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset ?

```{r}

Q7. What was the most popular candy bar in each year?

Q8. What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK, and all other countries?

```{r}
